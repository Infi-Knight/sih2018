# sih2018

A team of 6 members including me participated in Smart India Hackathon 2018 and pitched 3 ideas for the software edition out of which these two were selected for the grand finale:

## CareerBuddy (Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship)

I was the project leader for CareerBuddy under the team name BitChoir, an online portal for Helping youth make informed decisions on career choices in the vocational sector. You can read more about it in the file CareerBuddy.pdf.

## Swashakti (Ministry of Women and Child Development)

As a member of team Enigmators we pitched the idea for Swashakti, an application to endow women with the power of information to build their life skills and facilitate them in taking full advantages of the services provided by the government. You can read more about it in the file swashakti.pdf.

Unfortunately at the last moment three of our team members found themselves unable to uttend the grand finale due to travel issues and because of the participation rules for the contest our team got disqualified because replacement of only 2 members was allowed :(

However it was a great learning experince which extended over 3 months and included rigorous brainstorming sessions, prototyping and we came to know about problems our country is facing.
